# Endpoint-Telemetry-Research-Tool

A research-focused toolkit for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing **endpoint telemetry** data to improve understanding of endpoint behavior and enhance threat detection. Endpoint telemetry refers to the automated collection and analysis of system and security events from endpoint devices (e.g., laptops, servers, workstations) for performance insights and cybersecurity purposes. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 Overview

This project is designed to help security researchers, analysts, and developers:

- Gather telemetry data from endpoints
- Explore patterns in endpoint behavior
- Support detection logic development
- Perform research on how endpoints behave under various conditions
- Assist in threat hunting and incident investigation

Telemetry plays a crucial role in cybersecurity, offering a deep view into system activity that can help identify suspicious behavior, performance issues, or signs of compromise.
